# semantic_segmentation-voxelization

The results for the single object semantic segmentation were taken from the 2016 DAVIS challenge: https://davischallenge.org/davis2016/code.html. Out of the 16 available techniques (semi-supervised and supervised), I used the BVS (Bilateral Space Video Segmentation) method. Although the error comparison suggests that there are other methods yielding better segmentation, I found this one to be most consistent across frames. Some segmentation techniques start off better, but fade out after several frames. More about BSV can be found here: https://graphics.ethz.ch/~perazzif/bvs/index.html. 

This project uses semantic_segmentation.py to retrieve the masks from the DAVIS dataset and re-colors the object of interest in magenta, a color not seen in the video collection. Then, the images are processed in Houdini 16.5.350 in the provided .hip file, where they are voxelized. Houdini is a software that generates procedural content and allows for complex mesh manipulation among other things. Once the images have been voxelized, the create_video_from_sequences_of_images.py compiles the images into small videos. I've included small clips comparing the original unprocessed clips and their voxelized equivalent. 

Voxelization of semantic segmented images is a great way to add a 3D component to 2D images. It makes the objects stand out without the unnatural edge contours and weird coloration, and it was fun to implement.
